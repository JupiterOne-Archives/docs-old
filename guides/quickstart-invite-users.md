# Invite Users to Your J1 Account/Organization

Adding others to your J1 account/organization is done using a simple invitation
process. To send an invite:

1. Go to ![](../assets/icons/gear.png) **Settings**, select ![](../assets/icons/users.png) **Users & Access**.

1. In the user groups modal, click **Add Group** and enter a name for the new 
   group and, optionally, a description.
   
1. Click  ![](../assets/icons/add-user.png) **Add User** and enter the email address of the person you want 
   to invite.

1. Click ![](../assets/icons/send.png) **Send Invitation**.

   The user receives an invitation email to join your account/organization
   and is prompted to accept the invite upon login. New users are then prompted
   to create their J1 user account.

    other users.
