# Configure Managed Integrations

To get started using the JupiterOne (J1) platform, you must first pull your data into J1. The more data, the more powerful the J1 capabilities become.

There are multiple, managed integrations available, out-of-the-box, for turnkey configuration. 

Each integration may have a slightly different mechanism for authentication and configuration, as required by the provider. For example, the AWS integration uses an IAM role and assume role trust policies for access. Other integrations may use an API key/token, OAuth, or Basic Auth.

This video shows an example of how to configure an AWS integration.

For details on other integrations, see the respective documentation under **Managed Integrations**.

## Other Data

In addition, you can upload data outside of these managed integrations using the JupiterOne [API client or CLI](../j1-client-and-cli.md). This feature allows you to centrally track, monitor, and visualize any of your data, such as on-premise systems and security and compliance artifacts.
