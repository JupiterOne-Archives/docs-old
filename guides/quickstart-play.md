   ​


You access all of the J1 apps from the home page by clicking ![apps](../assets/icons/apps.png). If you need more assistance learning about the J1 user interface, read the [introduction documentation](./j1-what-is-it.md).

## Discover Your Assets

Your assets are operational entities such as code repositories, data stores, IAM policies and roles, security controls, people, and even vulnerability findings.

Modern security and visibility requires in-depth knowledge of your cyber assets and the insights that come from the relationships that connect them. J1 Assets provides meaningful context that you can use to strengthen your security program.

Look around at the playground data in J1 Assets by selecting a class and type of asset to filter on. and read more in the [product documentation](./asset-inventory-filters.md).

## Try Some Queries

J1 provides a [questions library](https://ask.us.jupiterone.io/filter?tagFilter=all) that updates on a regular basis. Have a look and try the queries associated with the questions.

J1 also provides a JupiterOne Query Language (J1QL) [tutorial](./tutorial-j1ql.md) to get familiar with the concept of queries. In general, you can consider every action that you want to do as a query. 

## Understand Alerts

You can use a  J1QL query for continuous auditing and threat monitoring. To be able to implement alerts, you must configure alerts rules first.  J1 provides some rules pack you can import to play with.

Try editing and running the rules queries and get used to how the interface works.

Read more about alerts in the [documentation](../compliance/compliance-overview.md).

## Understand the Compliance Dashboard

Playing with the Compliance app is also one action you should try in the J1 playground. The compliance dashboard enables you to quickly review your compliance status and download evidence against controls, policies, and procedures for HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI, and other frameworks.
