# Linking Controls to Compliance Requirements

Compliance controls are a series of policies and guidelines that your 
organization uses to reduce risk and help attain compliance. The J1 centralized 
controls library provides a single location to manage and use controls across frameworks. 

At the top of the controls library, you can see the total number of controls in your 
environment, as well as a snapshot of total adopted controls, and the number of policy 
domains using those controls. 

Click a control to add evidence, see how many requirements currently link to it, and any 
related policies and procedures.
