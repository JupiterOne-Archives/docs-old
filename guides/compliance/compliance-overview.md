# Compliance Management in JupiterOne

JupiterOne empowers your cybersecurity and GRC teams with a centralized,
compliance-as-code solution that automatically gathers evidence to support 
compliance needs and processes. JupiterOne gives you continuous compliance 
capabilities, leading to stronger security that goes beyond a single point in time.

The JupiterOne Compliance app is a flexible platform for you to import 
and manage any compliance standard or framework as a set of controls or 
requirements. 

## Getting Started with J1 Compliance

The first step in managing compliance is [adding the security frameworks](../compliance/compliance-import.md) to which
your organization wants to be compliant. Frameworks comprise of benchmarks, 
standards, and security questionnaires.

By default, J1 applies requirements to each framework to which you can then 
[add data-driven compliance evidence](../compliance/compliance-mapping-evidence.md) and link to controls.


You can use the Compliance app for each step in the security compliance workflow:

- [Perform automated gap analysis based on query results](../compliance/compliance-gap-analysis.md)

- [Export compliance artifacts as a summary or full evidence package](../compliance/compliance-export.md)



## Compliance Status and Maturity

The JupiterOne Compliance app provides measurements and status indicators at four
different maturity levels for each compliance standard and its requirements /
controls:

- Documented policies and procedures
- Implementation evidence, either via data-driven queries or external evidence
- Gap analysis between fulfilled requirements and outstanding remediation
- Continuous monitoring and remediation
