## Compliance Status and Maturity

The JupiterOne Compliance app provides measurements and status indicators at four
different maturity levels for each compliance standard and its requirements /
controls:

- Documented policies and procedures
- Implementation evidence, either via data-driven queries or external evidence
- Gap analysis between fulfilled requirements and outstanding remediation
- Continuous monitoring and remediation
