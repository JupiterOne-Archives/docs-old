# Compliance Management in JupiterOne

JupiterOne empowers your cybersecurity and GRC teams with a centralized,
compliance-as-code solution that automatically gathers evidence to support 
compliance needs and processes. JupiterOne gives you continuous compliance 
capabilities, leading to stronger security that goes beyond a single point in time.

The JupiterOne Compliance app is a flexible platform for you to import 
and manage any compliance standard or framework as a set of controls or 
requirements. 

## Getting Started with J1 Compliance

The first step in managing compliance is adding the security frameworks to which
your organization wants to be compliant. Frameworks comprise of benchmarks, 
standards, and security questionnaires.

Each framework has sets of controls or requirements that are grouped into 
categories. The controls and requirements are a series of policies and guidelines that 
instruct you how to comply with the framework.  By default, all the controls and 
requirements are applied to the framework. If you do not want to apply any controls 
or requirements, you can toggle them on or off.

J1 provides a library of controls and requirements but you can also add your own 
custom controls. Where applicable, J1 links security policies to controls and requirements.
You are able to link more policies at any time.

For the controls applicable to your frameworks, you must provide evidence of compliance. 




You can use the Compliance app for each step in the security compliance workflow:

- [Add compliance frameworks](../compliance/compliance-import.md)

- [Link policy procedures to each control or requirement](../compliance/compliance-mapping-policies.md)

- [Add data-driven compliance evidence by query questions](../compliance/compliance-mapping-evidence.md)

- [Perform automated gap analysis based on query results](../compliance/compliance-gap-analysis.md)

- [Export compliance artifacts as a summary or full evidence package](../compliance/compliance-export.md)



## Compliance Status and Maturity

The JupiterOne Compliance app provides measurements and status indicators at four
different maturity levels for each compliance standard and its requirements /
controls:

- Documented policies and procedures
- Implementation evidence, either via data-driven queries or external evidence
- Gap analysis between fulfilled requirements and outstanding remediation
- Continuous monitoring and remediation
