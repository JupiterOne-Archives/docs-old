# Compliance Management in JupiterOne

JupiterOne empowers your cybersecurity and GRC teams with a centralized,
compliance-as-code solution that automatically gathers evidence to support 
compliance needs and processes. JupiterOne gives you continuous compliance 
capabilities, leading to stronger security that goes beyond a single point in time.

The JupiterOne Compliance app is a flexible platform for you to import 
and manage any compliance standard or framework as a set of controls or 
requirements. You can use the Compliance app to:

- [Import a compliance standard or security questionnaire](../compliance/compliance-import.md)

- [Map policy procedures to each control or requirement](../compliance/compliance-mapping-policies.md)

- [Map data-driven compliance evidence by query questions](../compliance/compliance-mapping-evidence.md)

- [Perform automated gap analysis based on query results](../compliance/compliance-gap-analysis.md)

- [Export compliance artifacts as a summary or full evidence package](../compliance/compliance-export.md)



## Compliance Status and Maturity

The JupiterOne Compliance app provides measurements and status indicators at four
different maturity levels for each compliance standard and its requirements /
controls:

- Documented policies and procedures
- Implementation evidence, either via data-driven queries or external evidence
- Gap analysis between fulfilled requirements and outstanding remediation
- Continuous monitoring and remediation

Here is an example:
