# Compliance Management in JupiterOne

JupiterOne empowers your cybersecurity and GRC teams with a centralized,
compliance-as-code solution that automatically gathers evidence to support 
compliance needs and processes. JupiterOne gives you continuous compliance 
capabilities, leading to stronger security that goes beyond a single point in time.

The JupiterOne Compliance app is a flexible platform for you to import 
and manage any compliance standard or framework as a set of controls or 
requirements. 

## Getting Started with J1 Compliance

The first step in managing compliance is adding the security frameworks to which
your organization wants to be compliant. Frameworks comprise benchmarks, 
standards, and security questionnaires.

By default, J1 applies requirements to each framework to which you can then 
add data-driven compliance evidence and link to controls.


You can use the J1 Compliance app for each step in the security compliance workflow:

- [Select security frameworks](../compliance/compliance-import.md) 
- [Add data-driven compliance evidence](../compliance/compliance-mapping-evidence.md) 
- [Link to controls](../compliance/compliance-controls.md)
- [Link policies and procedures](../compliance/compliance-mapping-policies.md)
- [Perform automated gap analysis](../compliance/compliance-gap-analysis.md)
- [Export compliance artifacts](../compliance/compliance-export.md)



## Compliance Status and Maturity

The JupiterOne Compliance app Status view provides measurements and status indicators at four
different maturity levels for each compliance framework and its requirements and
controls:

- Documented policies and procedures
- Implementation evidence, either via data-driven queries or external evidence
- Gap analysis between fulfilled requirements and outstanding remediation
- Continuous monitoring and remediation
