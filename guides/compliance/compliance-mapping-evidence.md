# Compliance Mapping - Evidence

Each compliance requirement or control can have the following items as evidence:

- Mapped query questions
- Linked external evidence
- Additional notes

## Query Questions

From the compliance requirement details view, you can add a new question or map
an existing question to the selected requirement.

As long as data is represented within JupiterOne -- entities and relationships
that comes from either managed integrations or custom automation, writing
queries to provide data-drive compliance evidence is the recommended approach.

Each "question" can have one or more queries. The queries can be named to
trigger automated compliance gap analysis. See [this article](../compliance/compliance-gap-analysis.md) for more
details.

## External Evidence

In some cases, compliance evidence cannot be provided via data available in
JupiterOne. There are two ways to provide this evidence for a given control: 
as an external link to a document hosted outside of JupiterOne (such as on 
SharePoint or Google Docs), or using a direct uploaded (such as a screenshot or 
PDF).  

Both external evidence types require a name and have an optional description.

[Watch this video](https://try.jupiterone.com/blog/video-evidence-collection-with-the-compliance-app) to see examples of queries you can use to collect and map 
evidence to controls.

## Notes

Additionally, free form notes can be added to any compliance requirement or
control item to provide more details or context as needed. Each note, when
saved, will capture the author and timestamp.
