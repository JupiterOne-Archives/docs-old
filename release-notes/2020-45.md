## New Features

- More improvements made to the **Graph Viewer**:

    ![ui-actions-graph-viewer](../assets/ui-actions-graph-viewer.png)

  1. Option to lock/unlock the position of connected nodes when moving a graph node.

     > **Shift + Click** to select and move all connected nodes.

  2. Toggle between vertically-oriented and horizontally-oriented tree view.
  3. Save/download current graph view as PNG image.
  4. Action to re-center graph.
  5. Undo/Redo expand nodes action.

- UI to view **audit events** (accessible for account administrators only).

- Support **adding new and deleting policy/procedure documents** via the web
  interface in the **Policies** app.

- **Error indicator on the integrations list page** to show if one of the
  instances may require attention.

  - Also, click on the integration run status chip/bubble now goes directly to
    the jobs view for that integration instance.

- **Export/import Insight boards as JSON**, including chart configurations
  and positions. Also improved chart widgets and layouts of default dashboards.

- **Compliance Scope Filters** can be added for each compliance standard. The
  filters are applied across all compliance evidence queries mapped to that
  specific standard without the need for modifying the queries individually.
  
  > For example, a filter can be applied to limit compliance evidence queries on
  a subset of AWS accounts that are in scope for a PCI assessment instead all
  AWS accounts.
