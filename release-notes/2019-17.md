# JupiterOne 2019.17 Release

2019-03-05

## New Features

- New ingestion and analysis from **AWS**:

  - **ELB** entities - application load balancers and network load balancers

    Try `Find (aws_alb|aws_nlb)`

  - **ACM** certificates and relationships to resources that use each certificate

    Try `Find aws_acm_certificate that relates to * return tree`
    and `Find aws_acm_certificate that !USES *`

  - **CloudFront** distributions and their origins

    Try `Find aws_cloudfront_distribution that CONNECTS * return tree`

  - **WAF** and the resources they protect

    Try `Find aws_waf_web_acl that PROTECTS * return tree`

- **Vendor** are now automatically inferred and mapped from single sign on
  applications (e.g. a SAML application in Okta). Additional properties of each
  vendor can be added via the Asset Inventory app. This gives you a jumpstart in
  cataloging and managing vendors.

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Fixed missing tags for DynamoDB resources
- Raw data storage to support versioning and document store (e.g. policies)
