# JupiterOne 2019.26 Release

2019-07-15

_We focused mostly on technical backend/frontend improvements this past sprint
around performance, scalability, and core platform infrastructure. This lays the
ground work to allow us to bring you more exciting capabilities faster and more
reliably going forward._

_While that was happening, we did manage to squeeze in a few new things._

## Early Access / Beta Features

- Alert rules now support `SEND_SLACK_MESSAGE` as an action, using a
  pre-configured Slack Webhook to send alert message to a specific channel.

  For example:

  ```json
  {
    ...
    "operations": [
      {
        ...
        "actions": [
          ...
          {
            "type": "SEND_SLACK_MESSAGE",
            "webhookUrl": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/A1B2C3D4E/BCBD12345/..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where in certain scenarios, expanding a graph node to bring up
  additional neighbors did not work.

- Added scrolling pagination to the Vulnerability and Findings view in the
  Alerts app.
  
- AWS integration:

    - Added ENI and EIP support
    - Added Route53 Zones and Records support
    - Fixed an issue where security group rules pointing to external IP
      addresses / hosts were not propertly mapped

- Added `_integrationType` and `_integrationClass` metadata properties to
  entities from integrations, so that they can be queried like:

  ```j1ql
  Find * with _integrationType='aws' as e return e._type, count(e)
  ```

- Bugs fixes across integrations

- Improved mapper performance and tweaked a few mapping rules - docs around how
  mapper works coming soon

- Added "handle bar" on top of each Insights chart, so that text of a chart
  (especially from a table) can be selected without the chart being dragged
  around

- Misc. UI/UX improvements across Alerts, Insights, and Compliance apps

- Limitations on free/community accounts are now being enforced. See the
  [accounts and billing FAQ][1] for more details.
