### Google Cloud

- Added support for ingesting the following **new** resources:

    `google_cloud_sql_postgres_instance`, and
    `google_cloud_sql_sql_server_instance`
  - BigQuery: `google_cloud_big_query_dataset`
  - Compute: `google_compute_project`
  - DNS: `google_dns_managed_zone`

- New properties added to various existing resources for CIS benchmarks:

  - Compute
    - `google_compute_disk`:
      - `isCustomerSuppliedKeysEncrypted`
    - `google_compute_instance`:
      - `usesDefaultServiceAccount`
      - `usesFullAccessDefaultServiceAccount`
      - `blockProjectSSHKeys`
      - `isSerialPortEnabled`
      - `isShieldedVM`

    - `google_compute_subnetwork`:
      - `flowLogsEnabled`
    - `google_compute_network`:
      - `IPv4Range`

  - KMS
    - `google_kms_crypto_key`:

### Google Workspaces

- Fix execution timeouts for some larger Google Workspaces accounts

- Update the following properties on `google_user` entities:

  - Updated `active` to true when the user is not suspended and not archived and
    agreed to terms
  - Updated `mfaEnabled` to true when user is enrolled in 2SV (removed check for
    `isEnforcedIn2Sv`)
  - Removed `thumbnailPhotoEtag` since it is not a useful property to
    index/query on
  - Added normalized timestamp properties: `admin`, `createdOn`, `deletedOn`,
    and `lastLoginOn`
  - Set `employeeType` from `employeeInfo.description`, which corresponds to
    "Type of Employee" in the Google Admin UI under "Employee Information"
    section

### Jamf

- Fixed failure to handle Jamf hosts such as `https://jss.myjamf.com:8443/?failover`

### Qualys

- Adjusted pagination settings for host details fetching to address frequent connection errors

### Rapid7

- Fixed execution timeout by migrating integration to latest SDK and runtime environment

### Slack

- Changed `displayName` of `slack_user` to use `display_name` or `real_name` or `name`,
  fallback to `id` only when those are undefined.
- Changed `username` property to use value from `user.name` instead of `user.id`.
- Added `userId` property using value from `user.id`.
- Added `admin` boolean property to `slack_user`, as it is a normalized property
  on the `User` class entity.
- Added normalized boolean properties `active`, `archived`, `public`, `private`
  to the `slack_channel` entity.
