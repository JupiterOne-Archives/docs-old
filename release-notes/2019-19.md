    edit and continuously manage your organization's security policies and
    procedures directly online, using the web app;

  - a hierarchical graph view of the policies and the procedures that implements
    each policy, which serves as a visual proof to compliance auditors that the
    policies are fully implemented;

    view published version of the policies and procedures, and capture their
    acknowledgement and acceptance.

- Updated **Policy Builder CLI** with `publish` command to promote local copies
  of the policies and procedures to your JupiterOne account online, to easily
  take advantage of the new features in the web app.
