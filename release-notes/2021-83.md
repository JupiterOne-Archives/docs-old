# JupiterOne 2021.83 Release

November 5, 2021

## New Features and Improvements

- Assets in the Graph Viewer that have a *problem* associated with them now have 
  a visual indication and details of the problem in the properties side panel. 
  
- The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls Version 8 is now available as 
  a standard in the Compliance app with [the mapped controls](../guides/compliance/compliance-mapping-policies.md) to the default 
  procedures within the Policies app.
  
- You can now set a default layout for the Insights Graph Viewer widget: select either 
  mesh, horizontal tree, or vertical tree layout.
  
- You can now upload screenshots, videos, or other files in **Resources > Report an issue**.

## Integrations

You can now schedule integration job runs for a specific hour of the day or day of 
the week, depending on your customized polling configuration. This feature prevents 
J1 from consuming resources around mission-critical activities. Set the optional 
parameter, `pollingIntervalCronExpression`, using the [JupiterOne platform API](../docs/jupiterone-api.md) to use this capability. 
`!!! note` This functionality is not supported in the UI.

### AWS

J1 is no longer adding  `aws_lambda_function.codeLocation` to assets as it does not
provide any security insight value and only introduces a potential vulnerability and 
unnecessary versioning.

J1 is removing any AWS secret access keys from properties that are setting them when
the integration runs. Current values are now overwritten with the latest values and 
"REDACTED" appears in the place of the keys.

### Azure

### GitHub

-   When a JupiterOne GitHub application installation does not have permission to 
    fetch two-factor authentication information for `github_user`s, the `github_user` 
    `mfaEnabled` property is now assigned `undefined` instead of `false`.

### Qualys

- You can now enable or disable Qualys web application scan ingestion based on the integration configuration. 
  Toggle the new Ingest Web App Scans integration configuration option from the JupiterOne [Qualys integration](../docs/integrations/qualys/index.md) configuration page.

- JupiterOne now fetches Qualys findings (`qualys_host_finding`) with the Fixed status.

- The status filter for host detections is changed to explicitly request and ingest any 'New', 'Fixed', 'Active', 
  and 'Re-Opened' statuses. By default, 'Fixed' detections are not returned from Qualys unless explicitly specified. 
  This feature allows you to view the graph detections that are 'Fixed' and to track the changes to detections of any status.
