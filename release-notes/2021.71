# JupiterOne 2021.71 Release

2021-05-19

## New Features and Improvements

- Users can now search their policies & procedure templates for specific keywords

- Users are now able to export a single policy as a PDF

- All existing SOC 2 frameworks have been updated so they can now be managed from the UI rather than requiring users to edit the JSON file

- Added a new "Status" widget to the insights app that users can configure

- Revamped billing/products page 

- "Severity" and other fields are now normalized when attempting to filter findings in the alerts app (users no longer need to select "Low", "LOW", and "low" in order to search for all findings with a low severity, instead there is just now a single "Low" to select)

- Navigating to `/inventory` will now also take you to the asset inventory page (previously only `/assets` would)

- Added a logout button to the onboarding flow so users can still switch users/accounts if they need to

- Resolved some issues regarding importing rule packs after configuring your first integration

## Integrations

  integration instance.

  disks that do not have an image assigned (blank disks)

- [#140](https://github.com/JupiterOne/graph-google-cloud/issues/140) - Map more
  IAM permissions to service APIs, which will generate additional
  `google_cloud_api_service` **HAS** `google_iam_role` relationships

- New properties added to resources:
  - `google_compute_instance`
    - `webLink`
  - `google_compute_disk`
    - `webLink`

  | `google_cloud_api_service` | `HAS`      | `google_iam_role` |

- `google_user` is now created as a target entity through a mapped relationship
  to avoid duplicating information ingested by the Google Workspace integration.

### HackerOne

  attributes for onelogin users.

### SonarQube

Initial release of SonarQube integration (beta)! ðŸŽ‰ Check out the
[docs](https://github.com/JupiterOne/graph-sonarqube/blob/master/docs/jupiterone.md)
for details on what's currently supported.

### Tenable Cloud

- Handle `500` response fetching asset vulnerability details from Tenable
  (vulnerabilities for the asset are not ingested).

- Handle `404` response fetching host details for archived scans.

- Tenable client now correctly resets the retryDelay so that other status codes
  don't end up using the calculated retry delay from a 429 status code.
  
- Migrate to Tenable bulk export API endpoints for vulnerabilities and assets.

## Bug Fixes
 
- Resolved an issue where the Finding Details viewer would not have a max height and would cause large amounts of scrolling to be required
