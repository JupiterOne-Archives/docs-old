# JupiterOne 2021.67 Release

2021-03-24

## New Features

- During new account creation/onboarding, allow users to request access to a
  playground account to play with sample data.

- Added **Considerations** to provide better guidance when editing a policy procedure. 

- Automate the following related actions upon the creation of the first cloud
  infrastructure integration (AWS/Azure/Google Cloud):

  - Trigger the integration to run for the first time
  - Import alert rules related to the integration
  - Import the corresponding CIS benchmark to the Compliance app
  - Trigger the evaluation of all alert rules and benchmark
  - Add the account owner to the daily digest email
  - Display a modal that indicates these actions and progress

## Integrations

### atSpoke

- Requests are now ingested since the last execution time, or up to 14 days in
  the past, whichever is less. This removes the ability to configure the number
  of requests to ingest, focusing instead on simply ensuring that recent Requests
  are continuously ingested.
​
### Azure

- Added support for ingesting the following **new** resources:

  - `azure_location`
  - `azure_network_watcher`
  - `azure_security_group_flow_logs`
  - `azure_sql_server_firewall_rule`
  - `azure_location` **HAS** `azure_network_watcher`
​
- Added `encryption` to `azure_managed_disk`.
​
- Added `usesManagedDisks` to `azure_vm`.
​
- Added `queueAnalyticsLoggingReadEnabled`, `queueAnalyticsLoggingWriteEnabled`,
  and `queueAnalyticsLoggingDeleteEnabled` to `azure_storage_account`.
​
- Added `blobAnalyticsLoggingReadEnabled`, `blobAnalyticsLoggingWriteEnabled`,
  and `blobAnalyticsLoggingDeleteEnabled` to `azure_storage_account`.
​
- Added `blobSoftDeleteEnabled` and `blobSoftDeleteRetentionDays` to
  `azure_storage_account`
​
- Added `networkRuleSetDefaultAction` and `networkRuleSetBypass` properties to
  `azure_storage_account`.

- Fixed broken relationships between VM and disk entities. Previously, some
  relationships between VM and disk did not match case-sensitive, and created
  unresolvable relationships. Relationships will now be created based on
  case-insensitive matching of VM and disk IDs.
​
### Azure DevOps

- Initial release of Azure DevOps integration (beta) 🎉 

  Check out the
  [docs](../docs/integrations/azure-devops/index.md)
  for details on what's currently supported.
​
### Bitbucket

- Fixed an authentication error creating an access token at
  https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token now throws
  `IntegrationInstanceAuthenticationError` so that users no longer see
  `Unexpected error occurred executing integration!`.

### Google Cloud

Added support for ingesting the following **new** resources:

- Compute
  
  - `google_compute_instance_group_named_port`
  - `google_compute_instance_group` **HAS** `google_compute_instance_group_named_port`
​
- Pub/Sub
  
  - `google_pubsub_topic`
  - `google_pubsub_subscription`
​
- App Engine Admin
  
  - `google_app_engine_application`
  - `google_app_engine_service`
  - `google_app_engine_version`
  - `google_app_engine_instance`
​
- Cloud Run
  
  - `google_cloud_run_service`
  - `google_cloud_run_configuration`
  - `google_cloud_run_route`
​
Additionally:

- Added a `tag.` property to every entity for each label in the Google Cloud
  `labels` property. 
  
  For example, if a `google_storage_bucket` has a `labels` property with the
  values:

  ```json
  "labels": {
    "myLabel": "myLabelVal",
    "myOtherLabel": "myOtherLabelValue"
  }
  ```
​
  The following individual tags will be copied onto the entity: `tag.myLabel`,
  `tag.myOtherLabel`
​
### Jamf

- Added `name` property to `device_user`
​
- Added `version` and `path` properties to the `INSTALLED` relationship between
  a `computer` and a `macos_app`. This captures the version and path of an
  application installed on a specific computer and allows users to query that
  information as needed.
​
- Fixed failure to retry failed Jamf API requests.
​
- Fixed failure to ingest entities that contained raw data exceeding the
  system's allowed upload size. Unfortunately, this required the removal of raw
  data from some entities.
​
### Microsoft 365 - Intune

- Added support for ingesting a number of **Intune** resources. 

  Please review the [updated documentation](../docs/integrations/microsoft365/index.md) 
  to learn more. Intune data is ingested only when the Microsoft 365 account has Intune
  configured. ​

### PagerDuty

- Migrated to latest integration SDK for improved error handling and reporting.
​
- `User - ONCALL -> Service` relationship has been changed to `User - MONITORS -> Service`.
  
  > Relationships are best expressed as verbs, and `MONITORS` is the preferred
  > verb in this type of relationship.
​
- Added the following properties to the `User` entity: 

  `id`, `type`, `email`, `role`, `jobTitle`, `timeZone`, `billed`, `description`, `invitationSent`, `webLink`
​
### Qualys

- Host `Finding.targets` has been adjusted to include only 
  `[detection.HOST.IP, assetHost.fqdn, assetHost.ec2InstanceArn]`. 
  
  At this time, only `fqdn` and `ec2InstanceArn` will be used for mapping to the
  `Host` entity. This change reflects the two values that are actually used to
  resolve the relationship, significantly reducing the time spent looking for
  entities to map based on the global mapping rule. 

### Slack

- Add `emailDomain` property to `slack_user`
