  > in the organization who do not have a JupiterOne user account, or sharing with an external user such
  > as an auditor. 
  > 
  > Anyone with acccess to the link can view the dashboard. Please share with care. Shareable link does
  > not expire, but you can revoke the link / stop sharing at any time.
