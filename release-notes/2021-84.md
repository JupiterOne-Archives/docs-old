## Integrations

### Jamf

- Added support for `extension_attributes` on the  `user_endpoint` 
  asset (computer). An extension attribute appears as the property 
  `extensionAttribute.<id#>`, with a value equal to the array of 
  values of the JAMF extension attribute.

### JumpCloud

- Added support for ingesting the following new entity:

| Resources   | Entity `_type`          | Entity `_class` |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Application | `jumpcloud_application` | `Application`   |

- Added support for ingesting the following new relationships:

| Source Entity `_type` | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type`  |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| `jumpcloud_account`   | HAS               | `jumpcloud_application` |
| `jumpcloud_user`      | ASSIGNED          | `jumpcloud_application` |
| `jumpcloud_group`     | ASSIGNED          | `jumpcloud_application` |

## Fixes and Resolutions

- Deprecated MySecurity. We will remove this beta feature in December 2021. 
  In 2022, we expect to launch an improved version to guide
  you on which actions you own and need to take to improve your security posture.
  
- Fixed an issue where Problems would not appear on an asset in the graph viewer unless 
  the query had `return Tree` in it.
