## New Features and Improvements

- JupiterOne now provides an updated Compliance experience including a new total compliance status which aggregates adherence to selected individual compliance standards into a snapshot view as well as highlighting open risks, controls, people, and vendors.

- “Approves” asset relationships will now appear as green in the graph and “Denies” relationships will now appear as red.

- Users can now “Tag” rules in order to group them together and search for them more easily.

- Policy ID, Revision number, and "Powered by J1" footnote are now configurable by the user when downloading a Policy PDF.

- COMING SOON: J1QL queries will soon support returned property aliases. 

e.g.

     
      Find Person as p that is User as u
      Return
        p.name as Name, 
        p.acceptedSecurityPolicyOn as "Accepted Security Policy", 
        p.backgroundCheck as "Completed Background Check"

### Qualys

- JupiterOne by default ingests host detections with types Potential, Confirmed. We recommend avoiding ingesting Info detections until you are ready to process them in a meaningful way.


## Bug Fixes
 
- Fixed bug that caused `jupiterone_user` and `jupiterone_user_group` entities in the graph.

- Fixed bug that caused query policies to be combined improperly when users belong to multiple groups with different query policies. Query policies are now combined to expand scope if multiple query policies apply to user.
