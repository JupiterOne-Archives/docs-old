# JupiterOne 2021.86 Release

December 16, 2021

## New Features and Improvements

- Organization administrators can now create account-level API keys, which links the key to the organization account instead of an individual user account.
  
- Organization administrators can now parameterize sensitive values such as secrets for use in J1QL queries and questions without exposing the values.

- Vendor data in the public [vendor-stack](https://github.com/JupiterOne/vendor-stack) repository on GitHub is automatically used to enrich the 
  properties of the vendor asset when a new integration is enabled in your account. This action does not overwrite or replace any custom changes you 
  have made directly to the vendor assets. Updates to the [vendor-stack](https://github.com/JupiterOne/vendor-stack) repository are welcome. 
  This update was also published as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jupiterone/vendor-stack). 
  
- On Monday, December 20th, JupiterOne will provide a new login experience for users:

## Integrations

### AWS

We are working on improvements to the logic for how we identify `public: true`, `public: false` and `public: undefined` on S3 buckets that are ingested to J1 so they more closely match what is displayed in the AWS Console.  We expect to release these changes later this month. More details will be provided prior to the release.

### GitHub

Issues can now discover outside collaborators for CREATED and ASSIGNED relationships.  For example, to find outside collaborators that were assigned an issue in GitHub you can run the following J1QL query:

``` SQL
FIND github_user WITH role="OUTSIDE" AS user
THAT ASSIGNED github_issue AS issue
RETURN 
  user.username,
  issue.title,
  issue.state
```

### Google Cloud

- Properties added to entities:

| Entity                  | Property          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| `google_storage_bucket` | `versioningEnabled` |

- Properties added to relationships:

| Relationship                                            | Property    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `google_iam_binding_assigned_cloud_authenticated_users` | `projectName` |
| `google_iam_binding_assigned_domain`                    | `projectName` |
| `google_iam_binding_assigned_everyone`                  | `projectName` |
| `google_iam_binding_assigned_group`                     | `projectName` |
| `google_iam_binding_assigned_iam_role`                  | `projectName` |
| `google_iam_binding_assigned_iam_service_account`       | `projectName` |
| `google_iam_binding_assigned_user`                      | `projectName` |

- Properties removed from entities:

| Entity                            | Property             |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `google_cloud_folder`             | `projectId`            |
| `google_cloud_organization`       | `projectId`, `folders` |
| folder level `google_iam_binding` | `projectId`            |
| org level `google_iam_binding`    | `projectId`, `folders` |

- `rawData` is now stored for `google_iam_binding`

- When determining which project's `google_iam_binding`s to ingest, if a `projectId` is not specified in the configuration, the service account 
  `projectId` should be used instead.

- When making `google_iam_binding_allows_resource` relationships, J1 no longer checks to see if a service is enabled when determining if the 
  relationship should be mapped or direct. Because this verification is for non-organization integration instances, the Resource Manager API 
  does not need to be enabled to ingest a `google_cloud_project`.

### Google Workspace

- Added support for ingesting the following new resources:

| Resource        | Entity `_type`         | Entity `_class` |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------|
| Mobile Device   | `google_mobile_device` | Device          |

- To import mobile device entities you need to adjust your permissions in your Google Workspace account:

  1. Click **Security > API controls**
  2. In the **Domain wide delegation** pane, select **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.
  3. Click **Edit** near the JupiterOne Service Account and add a new entry under **API scopes** for `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.device.mobile.readonly`
  4. Click **Account > Admin roles**.
  5. Click the JupiterOne System role, and click Privileges
  6. Under **Services, Mobile Device Management**, enable **Manage Devices and Settings**

- Added the following new relationship:

| Source Entity '_type'  | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type`  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `google_account`       | MANAGES               | `google_mobile_device` |

### Jamf

- Added support for ingesting the following new resource:

| Resource        | Entity `_type`        | Entity `_class` |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ----------------|
| Computer Group  | `jamf_computer_group` | Group          |

- Added the following new relationship:

| Source Entity `_type` | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type`            |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `computer_group`      | HAS                   | `user_endpoint`                  |

- Now ingesting extension attributes as properties that are labeled as `extensionAttribute.<name>`.  For example, deployment status is ingested as the `extensionAttribute.Deployment Status`.

### Kubernetes

- Added support for ingesting the following new resources:

| Resource           | Entity `_type`   | Entity `_class` |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------|
| Kubernetes Volume  | `kube_volume`    | Disk            |

- Added the following new relationship:

| Source Entity '_type'  | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type`  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `kube_container_spec`  | USES                  | `kube_volume`          |

### OneLogin

Fixed an issue related to ingesting `App` entities.

### Qualys

- Added an option to include the first 300 bytes of detection results as `Finding.details` when the detection represents a vulnerability in the set of `vmdrFindingResultQids` provided in the configuration. If enabled, this adds to processing time due to the additional bytes transferred.

- Fixed an issue where `host_asset` properties were not correctly transferrign to `disovered_host` entities

## Fixes and Resolutions

- MySecurity is removed from JupiterOne. In 2022, we expect to launch an improved version to guide you on 
  which actions you own and need to take to improve your security posture.
