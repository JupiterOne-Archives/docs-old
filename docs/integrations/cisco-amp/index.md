# Integration with JupiterOne

## Cisco AMP + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize Cisco AMP endpoint agents and the devices they protect in the
  JupiterOne graph.
- Map Cisco AMP endpoint agents to devices and devices to the employee who is
  the owner.
- Monitor changes to Cisco AMP endpoints using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches Cisco AMP endpoints and the devices they
  protect to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires the endpoint hostname of the Cisco AMP account. The API
  Client ID and Key are also required.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Support

If you need help with this integration, please contact
[JupiterOne Support](https://support.jupiterone.io).

## Integration Walkthrough

The integration connects directly to [Cisco AMP for Endpoints REST API][1] to
obtain endpoint protection and configuration information.

## In Cisco AMP

To generate a Client ID and API Key:

- Log in to your **AMP for Endpoints Console**.
- Go to **Accounts** > **API Credentials**.
- Click **New API Credentials** to generate the Client ID and secure API Key.

Valid API Endpoints include:

- `api.amp.cisco.com`
- `api.apjc.amp.cisco.com`
- `api.eu.amp.cisco.com`

### In JupiterOne

1. From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to the **Cisco AMP** integration tile and click it.
3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

- Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Cisco AMP
  account in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
  `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
- Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
  the integration instance.
- Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
  needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
