# Integration with JupiterOne

## KnowBe4 + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize KnowBe4 user groups, users, training campaigns, and modules in the
  JupiterOne graph.
- Map KnowBe4 users and their associated trainings to the JupiterOne employee.
- Monitor changes to user groups, users, training campaigns, and modules using
  JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches KnowBe4 groups, users, and trainings to update
  the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires the site for where your account is located and an API
  key/token.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Integration Walkthrough

### In KnowBe4

You can generate a new key in your
[KnowBe4 Account Settings](https://training.knowbe4.com/account/info#api-settings)
under the API section. Be sure to request a key for the **Reporting API** not
the **User Event API**. After checking the `Enabled Reporting API Access`
checkbox, you must press the `Save Changes` button at the bottom. Refresh the
page to ensure that the changes were saved. Once confirmed, copy the API Token.
It'll be used in the next section.

KnowBe4 APIs are available to Platinum and Diamond customers only. See the
[KnowBe4 API Reference Guide](https://developer.knowbe4.com/reporting/) for more
info.

3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

  the integration instance.
